# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
Phrase.create([{ line: 'Pace' }, { line: 'Brave' }, { line: 'Cynical foul' }, { line: 'For my money/For me' }, { line: 'Any day of the week' }, { line: 'Stone penalty' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
