I built this app because I enjoy watching professional soccer, and I noticed that a lot of the same cliched terms came up in many games. What better way to take advantage of this than a soccer bingo card creator?!

Things I learned while making this app:

* How to randomize information retrieved from the database.

* This was my first experience with JavaScript. I used JS to implement the click/touch functionality for selecting phrases.
